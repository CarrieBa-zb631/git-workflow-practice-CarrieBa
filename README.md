**About:**

The app TikTok has drawn a lot of attention especially during the pandemic. As a software, it is quietly changing people's life and creating a new trend of media with short videos. In this article, it talks about how TikTok is changing the world. Everyone could find videos that interest them, and even create interesting videos to share with others. It gives everyone an opportunity to show their talents with a broader stage. The article shows how a software can make a huge change to the world. 

Moreover, it also mentioned why it could become such a popular app. Because "it’s easy to make a video on TikTok", and this is what is behind the scene about software development. Everyone could easily make a new short video, and in the chinese version of the app, you even can shop online. I think it is pretty interesting how software is taking a really important influence on the trend of everything, not only TikTok, but also many other social media, such as Instagram, facebook, and more.

###Comment （Jennie Wang）
I personally use TikTok everyday. The most impressive point of TIkTok for me is its algorithm -- after you select to watch several videos, the app will automatically predict what type of videos you will like and present them on your screen. The more times you choose to like or ignore the video, the more TikTok will get to know you. Furthermore, TikTok is becoming more and more popular in all over the world. Also, i am seconding Carrie's point that it actaully merge functions of several apps together: chatting, shopping, news spreading and etc. TikTok's popularity is skyrocketing especially in scuh pandemic pierod.
